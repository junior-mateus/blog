<!-- ## Welcome to My About Page

Hello! My name is Junior Mateus (OK, my name is not actually written that way, but it is how people call me). I’m a cybersecurity enthusiast, but I had not followed that passion until a few years ago. This blog (and my [channel](https://www.youtube.com/@iamjuniormateus) ) is where I share my journey, struggles, insights, and learnings in the world of cybersecurity.

- **Focus Areas**: Red teaming, malware and exploit development, and reverse engineering.
- **Programming**: C and Go (currently learning)
- **Mission**: To connect with like-minded individuals, seek knowledge, and have fun along the way.
